# This bot allows you to send and recieve messages and commands via a Discord channel.
# For Setup you can either use the documentation or read here (Documentation has images).
# Documentation: https://mccteam.github.io/g/bots/#discord-bridge
# Setup:
# First you need to create a Bot on the Discord Developers Portal, here is a video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FgMnZViNPA .
# /!\ IMPORTANT /!\: When creating a bot, you MUST ENABLE "Message Content Intent", "Server Members Intent" and "Presence Intent" in order for bot to work! Also follow along carefully do not miss any steps!
# When making a bot, copy the generated token and paste it here in "Token" field (tokens are important, keep them safe).
# Copy the "Application ID" and go to: https://discordapi.com/permissions.html .
# Paste the id you have copied and check the "Administrator" field in permissions, then click on the link at the bottom.
# This will open an invitation menu with your servers, choose the server you want to invite the bot on and invite him.
# Once you've invited the bot, go to your Discord client and go to Settings -> Advanced and Enable "Developer Mode".
# Exit the settings and right click on a server you have invited the bot to in the server list, then click "Copy ID", and paste the id here in "GuildId".
# Then right click on a channel where you want to interact with the bot and again right click -> "Copy ID", pase the copied id here in "ChannelId".
# And for the end, send a message in the channel, right click on your nick and again right click -> "Copy ID", then paste the id here in "OwnersIds".
# How to use:
# To execute an MCC command, prefix it with a dot ".", example: ".move 143 64 735" .
# To send a message, simply type it out and hit enter.

# or bot jumps onto the farm land and breaks it (this happens rarely but still happens). We are looking forward at improving this.
# It is recommended to keep the farming area walled off and flat to avoid the bot jumping.
# Also, if you have your farmland that is one block high, make it 2 or more blocks high so the bot does not fall through, as it can happen sometimes when the bot reconnects.
# The bot also does not pickup all items if they fly off to the side, we have a plan to implement this option in the future as well as drop off and bonemeal refill chest(s).

# This bot allows you to send and receive messages and commands via a Telegram Bot DM or to receive messages in a Telegram channel.
# /!\ NOTE: You can't send messages and commands from a group channel, you can only send them in the bot DM, but you can get the messages from the client in a group channel.
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Setup:
# First you need to create a Telegram bot and obtain an API key, to do so, go to Telegram and find @botfather
# Click on "Start" button and read the bot reply, then type "/newbot", the Botfather will guide you through the bot creation.
# Once you create the bot, copy the API key that you have gotten, and put it into the "Token" field of "ChatBot.TelegramBridge" section (this section).
# /!\ Do not share this token with anyone else as it will give them the control over your bot. Save it securely.
# Then launch the client and go to Telegram, find your newly created bot by searching for it with its username, and open a DM with it.
# Click on "Start" button and type and send the following command ".chatid" to obtain the chat id. 
# Copy the chat id number (eg. 2627844670) and paste it in the "ChannelId" field and add it to the "Authorized_Chat_Ids" field (in this section) (an id in "Authorized_Chat_Ids" field is a number/long, not a string!), then save the file.
# Now you can use the bot using it's DM.
# /!\ If you do not add the id of your chat DM with the bot to the "Authorized_Chat_Ids" field, ayone who finds your bot via search will be able to execute commands and send messages!
# /!\ An id pasted in to the "Authorized_Chat_Ids" should be a number/long, not a string!
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: If you want to recieve messages to a group channel instead, make the channel temporarely public, invite the bot to it and make it an administrator, then set the channel to private if you want.
# Then set the "ChannelId" field to the @ of your channel (you must include the @ in the settings, eg. "@mysupersecretchannel"), this is the username you can see in the invite link of the channel.
# /!\ Only include the username with @ prefix, do not include the rest of the link. Example if you have "https://t.me/mysupersecretchannel", the "ChannelId" will be "@mysupersecretchannel".
